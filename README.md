I have chosen career switch for my tribute page because it will reflect my story and I am here to change my career path.

I am part qualified account and most of my life I was working at retail or customer care roles, however I have always have interest on creating things that users were going to use. So, I am going through some option which I have highlighted on tribute page. Out of all the 3 option I have found software testing and coding is catching my eyes. So, I have done little more study about these subject matter and eventually I decided to go through coding. One day I was scrolling throw my fb account and School of code offer came up. So, I have done little more research for School of code, company house details, reviews and also youtube reviews then applied and rest is history. I haven't started my course yet but I already learned basic VS Code, HTML, CSS, git, github and JS introduction. Thanks to School of Code bootcamp pre-course. 

When I first saw the pre-course I was nervous because all these is very new to me. I take it one by one try to learned through all the possible way. Sometimes I have found video was more interesting then articles, however I really enjoy marksheet.io, freebootcamp lesson and codecademy. I was bit confused about git at the beginning but at the end when I go through the git cheat sheet and started using that Git command all started making sense. 

So, reflection of my journey so far keep reading and keep practicing eventually its all will make sense and when you get there its like a dream come true.
